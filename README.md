# iPlotly
A limited wrapper around Plotly to provide a more fluid plotting experience, especially when working interactively in a Jupyter notebook.

## Motivation

iPlotly provides an OO interface that makes common plotting tasks relatively easy.  An instance of Plot, the main object in iPlotly, can be mutated in-place via method chaining, which makes it easy to layer various chart primitives and style options.  This type of interface is especially useful when working interactively. 

*This is very much a work in progress!*
